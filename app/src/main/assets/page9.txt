Beier and colleagues' study does not invalidate previous estimates of trauma among Neanderthals.Instead, it provides a new framework for interpreting these data by showing that the level of Neanderthal trauma was not uniquely high relative to that of early humans in Eurasia.This implies that Neanderthal trauma does not require its own special explanations,and that risk and danger were as much a part of the life of Neanderthals as they were of our own evolutionary past.The result adds to growing evidence that Neanderthals had much in common with early human groups. However, the finding that Neanderthals might have experienced trauma at a younger age than humans, or that they had a greater risk of death after injury, is fascinating,and might be a key insight into why our species had such a demographic advantage over Neanderthals.
