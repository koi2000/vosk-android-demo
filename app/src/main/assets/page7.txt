The more complete the fossils are, the more likely they are to have preserved evidence of injuries. This might seem obvious, but is an issue often ignored in such studies.Beier et al. offer a way to deal with this type of bias in the available material.Once the authors take into account the extent of fossil preservation, the predicted prevalence of trauma in Neanderthals and humans is almost the same.
