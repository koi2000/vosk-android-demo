Injuries are part of everyday life, from a scratch on the skin to a broken bone to a fatal trauma.Although many injuries are accidental, others can arise as a consequence of an individual's or a group's behaviour, activity or social normsâ€” characteristics that tell us about societies and the inherent tensions and risks within and between different groups.On page 686, Beier et al. provide evidence that challenges the long-standing viewthat Neanderthal populations experienced a level of traumatic injuries that was significantly higher than that of humans.The result calls into question claims that the behaviour and technologies of Neanderthals exposed them to particularly high levels of risk and danger.
