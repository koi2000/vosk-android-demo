Woody Guthrie
1.£¨00:00£©I'm Mary Tillotson. And I'm Steve Ember with the VOA Special English program, PEOPLE IN AMERICA.£¨00:08£© Today, we begin a two-part story about songwriter and singer Woody Guthrie. £¨00:13£©He wrote songs about common people and social issues in the nineteen thirties. His music influenced many people.
2.£¨00:00£© Imagine you are in America in the nineteen thirties. £¨00:03£©A train passes through the countryside. £¨00:06£©It is night time.£¨00:07£© And the only sound that can be heard is the long, lonely whistle coming from the train's engine.£¨00:14£© Inside the train's boxcars are groups of men sitting or lying on the floors. £¨00:19£©The men are dirty and their clothing is torn. £¨00:23£©In one boxcar, a short man with long, curly brown hair is playing a guitar and singing.£¨00:31£© His name is Woody Guthrie.£¨00:34£© He is singing a song about men who look for work as they travel from town to town.
3.£¨00:00£© Woodrow Wilson Guthrie was born in nineteen twelve in the American state of Oklahoma.£¨00:08£© The Guthrie family lived in a small farming town called Okemah. £¨00:14£©Woody's father, Charles, was a businessman who bought and sold land. £¨00:20£©Woody's mother, Nora, was a school teacher. £¨00:24£©She also liked to play the piano and sing.£¨00:29£© When Woody was young, his mother sang him songs she had learned as a girl. £¨00:34£©These songs told stories about love and death and difficult times.
4. £¨00:00£©Woody's early years were happy ones.£¨00:02£© But his life began to change when he was only ten years old.£¨00:07£© One day, his sister, Clara, spilled oil on her dress and accidentally set herself on fire. She died the next day.£¨00:17£© Woody never forgot her death.
5. £¨00:00£©As time passed, Woody's mother began acting strangely.£¨00:04£© She lost control over her actions and speech. £¨00:08£©Many people thought she was insane. £¨00:10£©Because of this, the Guthrie family became more private as they attempted to hide Nora's problems.
6.£¨00£º00£© The loss of his daughter and his wife's suffering ruined Charles Guthrie.£¨00:05£© He began drinking alcohol.£¨00:07£© His business soon failed. £¨00:10£©The Guthrie family left Okemah and lived in several towns in Oklahoma and Texas. £¨00:16£©Young Woody often had to work instead of attending school because his family was poor.
7. £¨00:00£©The first musical instrument Woody learned to play was the harmonica. £¨00:05£©He learned to play the harmonica by watching an old man play the instrument. £¨00:11£©Woody learned how to play the guitar by watching his father's brother play. £¨00:16£©In the nineteen twenties, Woody was living in the town of Pampa, Texas. £¨00:23£©Pampa was known as a "boom town" because it had grown quickly after oil was discovered nearby.
8.£¨00:00£© On weekends, Woody joined other young men to play music at dances in the town. £¨00:07£©Years later, Woody described what singing meant to him:
9.£¨00:00£© "When you sing a song, it reaches out and enters people's ears.£¨00:05£© It makes them jump up and down, and sing it with you.£¨00:08£© The best part about singing is that you can sing what you think. £¨00:13£©You can tell all kinds of stories in a song, and put your ideas across to another person."
10.£¨00:00£©Woody liked to communicate with other people through his music.£¨00:04£© Yet he did not like to say much about himself.£¨00:08£© One reason for this was that he did not want people to know that his mother was in a hospital for insane people. £¨00:17£©Nora Guthrie suffered from Huntington's Chorea, a disease that destroys the brain and nervous system. £¨00:25£©Woody knew that someday he also might develop the disease.
11.£¨00:00£© He was seventeen years old when his mother died, in nineteen twenty-nine. £¨00:06£©That was the year when the economy of the United States began to slow down. £¨00:11£©Over the next several years, many Americans lost their jobs. £¨00:14£©The period became known as the Great Depression.
12. £¨00:00£©In Pampa, the oil fields dried up.£¨00:03£© Farms in many areas failed because little or no rain fell for several years. £¨00:10£©The land became so dry that wind easily blew away the top soil.£¨00£º16£© These areas of Texas, Oklahoma and other states became known as the Dust Bowl.
13.£¨00:00£© Like many other people, Woody Guthrie left Pampa to travel around Texas and the Southwest looking for work.£¨00:10£© He often made trips by train.£¨00:13£© But because he had no money, he would jump on the train's boxcars and ride for free. £¨00:19£©This was often dangerous, because guards on the train would throw the men off or arrest them.£¨00:25£© However, Woody found this life exciting.£¨00:29£©One of the first songs he wrote was about leaving home and fleeing the Dust Bowl.
14. £¨00:00£©Woody Guthrie married Mary Jennings in nineteen thirty-three. £¨00:04£©They had three children. £¨00:06£©Three years later, Woody left his family and traveled to California.£¨00:12£© He met many kinds of people during his travels.£¨00:16£© He also learned songs from many different parts of the country.£¨00:20£© Yet what affected him most was the suffering he saw. £¨00:24£©He said: "When I saw hard-working people suffering under debts, sickness and worries, I knew there was plenty to make up songs about."
15.£¨00:00£© In California, Woody earned money by playing his guitar and singing. £¨00:05£©Later, he began performing on a radio program with a friend, Maxine Crissman. £¨00:11£©She was called Lefty Lou.£¨00:14£© They had one of the most popular radio programs in Los Angeles. £¨00:19£©They sang songs Woody had written about social issues.£¨00:23£© His best songs were about the troubles Americans faced during the Depression.£¨00:27£© This song is about the dangers of coal mining.£¨00:32£© It is called "The Dying Miner."
16.£¨00:00£© In nineteen thirty-eight, Woody Guthrie left the radio program to travel around California. £¨00:06£©He found that conditions had become worse for many people who had lost their land and fled the Dust Bowl.
17.£¨00:00£© Most of these "Dust Bowl refugees" could only find seasonal farm work like gathering fruit from trees. £¨00:07£©Farm owners did not pay these workers much money. £¨00:11£©The workers lived in camps that were often dirty and had no running water.£¨00:15£© Hunger and sickness were widespread. £¨00:19£©The people in the camps seemed to have lost all hope of improving their lives.£¨00:25£© Woody wrote a song about them called "Dust Bowl Refugees."
18. £¨00:00£©The oppression and bad conditions in the workers' camps made Woody Guthrie angry. £¨00:05£©He began helping labor organizers establish unions to help the workers.£¨00:11£© Next week, we tell about how he traveled to New York City and became a well-known musician.
