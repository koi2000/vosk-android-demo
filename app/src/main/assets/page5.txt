The power of Beier and colleagues' analyses lies in their study design.Instead of comparing Neanderthal data with those of more-recent or living human populations,as previous studies have done, the authors based their comparisons on humans who not only shared aspects of their environment with Neanderthals,but whose fossil record also has a similar level of preservation. Beier et al. analyzed data for 114 Neanderthal skulls and 90 human skulls. They gathered the data for 14 skull bones, and obtained information that ranged from 1 bone in poorly preserved fossils to data for all 14 bones per individual for well-preserved ones. In total, the authors recorded trauma incidence in 295 Neanderthal bones and 541 human bones.They also collected other information, such as the percentage of each of the 14 bones that was preserved for each individual, as well as details including sex, age at death and the fossil's geographic location.
