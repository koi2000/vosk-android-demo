Lastly, the causes of the injuries could provide some elusive insights into behaviour, activities or social norms in the past.From the shape, location and extent of traumatic injuries in skeletons, and characteristics such as the sharpness of fracture edges or the degree to which injuries had healed,it is sometimes possible to establish the most likely cause of a traumaâ€” for example, whether the injury probably arose as a consequence of a hunting accident, interpersonal violence or inter-group conflict.Moreover, surviving severe trauma might indicate that the injured person was cared for by members of their society.Establishing the likelihood of each of these scenarios among Neanderthals and early modern humans will no doubt continue to challenge scientists for many years to come.
