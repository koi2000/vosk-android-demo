Both Neanderthal and human males had a much greater incidence of trauma than did the females of their respective species.This pattern remains the same for humans today.One final intriguing result is that, although traumatic injuries were present across all of the age ranges studied,Neanderthals that had trauma to the head were more likely to have died under the age of 30 than the humans were. The authors interpret this result as evidence that, compared with humans, Neanderthals either had more injuries when they were young or were more likely to have died after being injured.
