1.	Injuries are part of everyday life, from a scratch on the skin to a broken bone to a fatal trauma. 0:06Although many injuries are accidental, others can arise as a consequence of an individual’s or a group’s behaviour, activity or social norms0:15 — characteristics that tell us about societies and the inherent tensions and risks within and between different groups.0:22On page 686, Beier et al. provide evidence that challenges the long-standing view0:29 that Neanderthal populations experienced a level of traumatic injuries that was significantly higher than that of humans.0:37 The result calls into question claims that the behaviour and technologies 0:42of Neanderthals exposed them to particularly high levels of risk and danger.
2.	Reports of injuries and deaths are constantly in the news.0:05 As well as being drawn to read the stories of individuals, such information is of interest because of what it tells us about our societies.0:14 However, to fully understand what might determine the current degree of violence and injuries, 0:19we also need to look back at the past and identify the causal under pinnings0:24. But how far back should we look? 0:26Arguably, right back to the evolutionary origins of processes that shape behavioural0:32, social and cognitive tendencies and abilities. 
3.	Anthropologists study skeletal remains to reconstruct aspects of ancient lives0:05, building an ‘osteo-biography’ that casts light on part of the life history of an individual.0:12 Skeletons preserve — in the form of holes, misshapen surfaces, bone misalignments and secondary fractures0:20 radiating out from a point of impact 0:22— a signature of the traumas that resulted in fractured0:26, cut or perforated bones, even if the injuries subsequently healed. 
4.	Traumatic lesions have been frequently identified in Neanderthal fossils, particularly in the head and neck,0:08 leading to the view that higher levels of skeletal injury occurred in Neanderthal populations than in human populations.0:15 However, this is not so, say Beier and colleagues0:20. The authors assessed published descriptions of Neanderthal and modern human fossil skulls0:26 found in Eurasia from approximately 80,000 to 20,000 years ago.0:32Comparing the number of injured and non-injured Neanderthal and human skulls0:36, the authors report similar levels of head trauma in both groups. 
5.	The power of Beier and colleagues’ analyses lies in their study design.0:06 Instead of comparing Neanderthal data with those of more-recent or living human populations0:12, as previous studies have done, the authors based their comparisons on humans 0:17who not only shared aspects of their environment with Neanderthals0:21, but whose fossil record also has a similar level of preservation0:25. Beier et al. analyzed data for 114 Neanderthal skulls and 90 human skulls.0:32 They gathered the data for 14 skull bones, （00:36）and obtained information that ranged from 1 bone in poorly preserved fossils to data for all 14 bones（00:44）per individual for well-preserved ones.（00:48） In total, the authors recorded trauma incidence in 295 Neanderthal bones and 541 human bones.（00:56）They also collected other information, such as the percentage of each of the 14 bones that was preserved for each individual, （01:03）as well as details including sex, age at death and the fossil’s geographic location.（01:09） 
6.	Beier et al. ran two sets of statistical analyzes — one based on the presence or absence of trauma in each of the skull bones,0:09 the other on individual fossil skulls as a whole0:13 — to test whether there were any statistically significant differences between the prevalence of trauma in the Neanderthal and human fossils0:22. The authors also assessed whether trauma prevalence was linked to sex or age,0:27 taking into account fossil preservation, geographic location and possible inter action effects 0:35between the different variables.0:36 The two analyses gave similar results. 
7.	The more complete the fossils are, the more likely they are to have preserved evidence of injuries.0:07 This might seem obvious, but is an issue often ignored in such studies.0:13 Beier et al. offer a way to deal with this type of bias in the available material0:18. Once the authors take into account the extent of fossil preservation, 0:22the predicted prevalence of trauma in Neanderthals and humans is almost the same. 
8.	Both Neanderthal and human males had a much greater incidence of trauma than did the females of their respective species. 0:08This pattern remains the same for humans today.0:11 One final intriguing result is that, although traumatic injuries were present across all of the age ranges studied,0:18 Neanderthals that had trauma to the head were more likely to have died under the age of 30 than the humans were.0:25 The authors interpret this result as evidence that, compared with humans, Neanderthals either had more injuries0:33 when they were young or were more likely to have died after being injured.   
9.	Beier and colleagues’ study does not invalidate previous estimates of trauma among Neanderthals.0:07 Instead, it provides a new framework for interpreting these data by showing that the level of Neanderthal trauma was not uniquely0:15 high relative to that of early humans in Eurasia. 0:19This implies that Neanderthal trauma does not require its own special explanations,0:25 and that risk and danger were as much a part of the life of Neanderthals 0:29as they were of our own evolutionary past.0:33 The result adds to growing evidence that Neanderthals had much in common with early human groups.0:40 However, the finding that Neanderthals might have experienced trauma at a younger age than humans,0:46 or that they had a greater risk of death after injury, is fascinating,0:49 and might be a key insight into why our species had such a demographic advantage over Neanderthals.
10.	Is this the final word on the subject of Neanderthal trauma?0:05 The answer is no0:06. Beier and colleagues assessed only skull trauma. 0:09What if Neanderthals accumulated more injuries to their bodies than did humans?0:13 There are data suggesting that this might be the case. 0:17Furthermore, although the authors’ analyzes demonstrate the power of a well-designed study based on large samples, 0:25the data they used were recorded by many researchers and at varying levels of detail0:30, raising the possibility of methodological biases. 
11.	Lastly, the causes of the injuries could provide some elusive insights into behaviour, activities or social norms in the past.0:08 From the shape, location and extent of traumatic injuries in skeletons,0:13 and characteristics such as the sharpness of fracture edges or the degree to which injuries had healed,0:19 it is sometimes possible to establish the most likely cause of a trauma0:23 — for example, whether the injury probably arose as a consequence of a hunting accident, 0:29interpersonal violence or inter-group conflict.0:32 Moreover, surviving severe trauma might indicate that the injured person was cared for by members of their society.0:39 Establishing the likelihood of each of these scenarios among Neanderthals and early modern humans0:46 will no doubt continue to challenge scientists for many years to come.
