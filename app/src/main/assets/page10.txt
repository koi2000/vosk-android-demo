Is this the final word on the subject of Neanderthal trauma? The answer is no. Beier and colleagues assessed only skull trauma.What if Neanderthals accumulated more injuries to their bodies than did humans?There are data suggesting that this might be the case.Furthermore, although the authors' analyzes demonstrate the power of a well-designed study based on large samples,the data they used were recorded by many researchers and at varying levels of detail, raising the possibility of methodological biases.
