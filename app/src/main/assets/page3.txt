Anthropologists study skeletal remains to reconstruct aspects of ancient lives, building an 'osteo-biography' that casts light on part of the life history of an individual.Skeletons preserve — in the form of holes, misshapen surfaces, bone misalignments and secondary fracturesradiating out from a point of impact — a signature of the traumas that resulted in fractured, cut or perforated bones, even if the injuries subsequently healed.
